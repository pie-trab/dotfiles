# dotfiles

All my dotfiles, configurations and themes for diffrent software.
\
To setup all the files execute the `setup.sh` script. The script will make shure to backup all the older configuration files, if they exists, adding `..._old` to the end. 

## Vim
For vim it will be copied the `.vimrc` file and the `.vim/colors` folder with a copy of the [catpuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/vim) themes for vim. \

## TODO
- [ ] Link the catpuccin repo for always updated themes
