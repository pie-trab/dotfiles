# dotfiles

All my dotfiles, configurations and themes for diffrent software.


## Vim
To configure vim stuff rename the `vimrc` file to `.vimrc`, then move it to your user root. \
There is a copy of the [catpuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/vim) themes for vim in the `/color` folder. \
To install the themes move the content of the color folder under the `.vim/colors/` folder on Linux or the `.vimfiles\colors` folder on Windows.
